	description "Traditionally, ships turn around so that they can use their main thrusters for deceleration. Some ships, however, are too ungainly for such maneuvers to be convenient, or carry sensitive cargo that must not be being swung around quickly. For such ships, a reverse thruster allows them to apply thrust smoothly backwards."
	description "	Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section."

	description `The original form of the Ichra-04 E-Railgun, 2-gun mounted on a turret complete with highly advanced stabilizing system and rotor allowing it to fire at maximum accuracy and turn as fast as something half of its size. It is one of the largest and most powerful weapon the Geeva is capable of making, although barely. Due to the cost and difficulty of manufacturing one very few were made since the evacuation and fewer in active service. Only few are still being built today mostly to maintain the expertise for the time it may be required again.`

	description "Geeva long-ranged energy railgun firing unidentified matter synthesized at the core of the gun. First used during the evacuation used as one of their primary ship to ship weapon but with limited production due to its alien design and construction making it one of the more difficult weapon to mass produce and were reserved for wartime use only. Finishing quality of these railguns can vary quite a bit among different manufacturers due to difficulty of making them even such it's mostly cosmetic and all of the weapon in stock don't have any notable performance difference. It was said that there's only one place in the Geeva space that can produce reliable core component for it."
